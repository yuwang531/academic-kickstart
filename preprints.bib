Specifically, we learn a policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying the LTL formula without learning the transition probabilities. We introduce a novel rewarding and path-dependent discounting mechanism based on the LTL formula such that (i) an optimal policy maximizing the total discounted reward effectively maximizes the  probabilities of satisfying LTL objectives, and (ii) a model-free RL algorithm using these rewards and discount factors is guaranteed to converge to such policy. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our RL-based synthesis approach on two motion planning case studies.},

  abstract = {STMC is a statistical model checker that uses antithetic and stratified sampling techniques to reduce the number of samples and, hence, the amount of time required before making a decision. The tool is capable of statistically verifying any black-box probabilistic system that PRISM can simulate, against probabilistic bounds on any property that PRISM can evaluate over individual executions of the system. We have evaluated our tool on many examples and compared it with both symbolic and statistical algorithms. When the number of strata is large, our algorithms reduced the number of samples 336\% on average. Furthermore, being a statistical model checker makes STMC able to verify models that are well beyond the reach of current symbolic model checkers. On large systems (up to 1014 states) STMC was able to check 100\% of benchmark systems, compared to existing methods which only succeeded on 14\% of systems. The tool, installation instructions, benchmarks, and scripts for running the benchmarks are all available online as open source.},

  author = {Wang, Yu and Bozkurt, Alper Kamil and Pajic, Miroslav},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES) in the presence of attacks that tamper with inputs and outputs of the plant. We consider a very general system setup as we focus on both deterministic and nondeterministic plants that we model as finite state transducers (FSTs); this also covers the conventional approach to modeling DES as deterministic finite automata. Furthermore, we cover a wide class of attacks that can nondeterministically add, remove, or rewrite a sensing and/or actuation word to any word from predefined regular languages, and show how such attacks can be modeled by nondeterministic FSTs; we also present how the use of FSTs facilitates modeling realistic (and very complex) attacks, as well as provides the foundation for design of attack-resilient supervisory controllers. Specifically, we first consider the supervisory control problem for deterministic plants with attacks (i) only on their sensors, (ii) only on their actuators, and (iii) both on their sensors and actuators. For each case, we develop new conditions for controllability in the presence of attacks, as well as synthesizing algorithms to obtain FST-based description of such attack-resilient supervisors. A derived resilient controller provides a set of all safe control words that can keep the plant work desirably even in the presence of corrupted observation and/or if the control words are subjected to actuation attacks. Then, we extend the controllability theorems and the supervisor synthesizing algorithms to nondeterministic plants that satisfy a nonblocking condition. Finally, we illustrate applicability of our methodology on several examples and numerical case-studies.},

  abstract = {We study the differential privacy of sequential statistical inference and learning algorithms that are characterized by random termination time. Using the two examples: sequential probability ratio test and sequential empirical risk minimization, we show that the number of steps such algorithms execute before termination can jeopardize the differential privacy of the input data in a similar fashion as their outputs, and it is impossible to use the usual Laplace mechanism to achieve standard differentially private in these examples. To remedy this, we propose a notion of weak differential privacy and demonstrate its equivalence to the standard case for large i.i.d. samples. We show that using the Laplace mechanism, weak differential privacy can be achieved for both the sequential probability ratio test and the sequential empirical risk minimization with proper performance guarantees. Finally, we provide preliminary experimental results on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) and Landsat Satellite Data Sets from the UCI repository.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) is frequently used to formally specify control objectives such as probabilistic reachability and safety. In this work, we focus on model checking PCTL specifications statistically on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by sampling, e.g., checking whether there exists a feasible policy such that the probability of reaching certain goal states is greater than a threshold. We use reinforcement learning to search for such a feasible policy for PCTL specifications, and then develop a statistical model checking (SMC) method with provable guarantees on its error. Specifically, we first use upper-confidence-bound (UCB) based Q-learning to design an SMC algorithm for bounded-time PCTL specifications, and then extend this algorithm to unbounded-time specifications by identifying a proper truncation time by checking the PCTL specification and its negation at the same time. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on case studies.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose the temporal logic HyperPCTL*  that extends PCTL  and HyperPCTL to reason about probabilistic hyperproperties. It allows expressing probabilistic hyperproperties with nested temporal and probability operators. We show that HyperPCTL* can express important probabilistic information-flow security policies. Furthermore, for the first time, we investigate statistical model checking (SMC) algorithms for HyperPCTL*  specifications in discrete-time Markov chains (DTMC). To this end, we first study SMC for HyperPCTL*  specifications with non-nested probability operators for a desired confidence or significance level. Unlike existing SMC algorithms which are based on sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT), we use the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval to avoid the need of a priori knowledge on the indifference margin. Then, we extend the proposed SMC algorithms to HyperPCTL*  specifications with multiple probability operators that are nested in different ways. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms on two examples, dining cryptographers and probabilistic causation.},

We show that by properly choosing the representation of the DTMCs, semantically negatively correlated samples can be generated for a fraction of PCTL formulas via the stratified or antithetic sampling techniques. Using stratified or antithetic samples, we propose statistical verification algorithms with asymptotic correctness guarantees based on sequential probability ratio tests, and show that these algorithms are more sample-efficient than the algorithms using independent Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, the efficiency of the statistical verification algorithm with stratified and antithetic samples is demonstrated by numerical experiments on several benchmarks.},
