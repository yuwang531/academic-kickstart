I am a postdoctoral associate at [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University. My research focuses on autonomy, control, and robotics via machine learning and formal methods. 

<span style="color:#f76497">
I will be joining the University of Florida this fall. Please feel free to send me your CV if you are interested in joining my research group.
