<p><b>Title</b>:
Statistical Verification of Hyperproperties
for Cyber-Physical Systems</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:
Many important properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined upon the relationship between multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time. Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. In this talk, I will first introduce new hyper probabilistic temporal logics that formally capture these hyperproperties. Then, I will introduce new statistical model checking (SMC) techniques for verifying hyper logic formulas. Finally, I will demonstrate the efficiency of the SMC algorithms on CPS benchmarks with varying levels of complexity.</p>
