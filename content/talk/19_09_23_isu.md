<p><b>Title</b>:
Verifying the Security of Cyber-Physical Systems</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) operate in a wide range of applications, where their security is a major concern. Verifying security properties, commonly specified by temporal logics, can be difficult, due to either the lack of accurate models or the modelsâ€™ complexity. In this talk, several recent efforts on addressing this problem will be presented. First, I will present a new model reduction method for building approximate bisimulations between complex CPS and finite state Markov chains. Then, I will present a few new statistical model checking techniques using anti-correlated samples and reinforcement learning.</p>
