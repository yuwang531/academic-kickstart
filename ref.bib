  title = {Security-Aware Synthesis Using Delayed-Action Games},
  copyright = {All rights reserved},
  abstract = {Stochastic multiplayer games (SMGs) have gained attention in the field of strategy synthesis for multi-agent reactive systems. However, standard SMGs are limited to modeling systems where all agents have full knowledge of the state of the game. In this paper, we introduce delayed-action games (DAGs) formalism that simulates hidden-information games (HIGs) as SMGs, by eliminating hidden information by delaying a player's actions. The elimination of hidden information enables the usage of SMG off-the-shelf model checkers to implement HIGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a DAG can be decomposed into a number of independent subgames. Since each subgame can be independently explored, parallel computation can be utilized to reduce the model checking time, while alleviating the state space explosion problem that SMGs are notorious for. In addition, we propose a DAG-based framework for strategy synthesis and analysis. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of the DAG-based synthesis framework on a case study of a human-on-the-loop unmanned-aerial vehicle system that may be under stealthy attack, where the proposed framework is used to formally model, analyze and synthesize security-aware strategies for the system.},

We propose to model such attacks as nondeterministic finite state transducers (FSTs) and show how FSTs can be used to capture a very wide class of attacks including all previously considered attacks on DES, as well as additional attacks and attack features reported in recent security incidents.
We study the supervisory control problem in cases when attacks occur: (i) only on the sensors, (ii) only on the actuators, and (iii) both on the actuators and sensors of the plant. For each case, we present new sets of controllability theorems and synthesizing algorithms for attack-resilient supervisors. On a series of examples, we illustrate the use of our approach for modeling and design of such security-aware supervisory control.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study supervisory control of discrete event systems in the presence of network-based attacks on information delivered to and from the supervisors. The attacks are modeled by finite state transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible attack behavior is the desired one \textendash{} we refer to such supervisors as attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the design algorithm for an attackresilient supervisor, in scenarios where no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it. Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a desired language is controllable with intermittently secure communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach on several examples.},

  title = {Statistical Verification of Hyperproperties for Cyber-Physical Systems},
  copyright = {All rights reserved},
  abstract = {Many important properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined upon the relationship between multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time. Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. In this work, we focus on verifying probabilistic hyperproperties for CPS. To cover a wide range of modeling formalisms, we first propose a general model of probabilistic uncertain systems (PUSs) that unify commonly studied CPS models such as continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and probabilistically parametrized Hybrid I/O Automata. To formally specify hyperproperties, we propose a new temporal logic, hyper probabilistic signal temporal logic (HyperPSTL) that serves as a hyper and probabilistic version of the conventional signal temporal logic (STL). Considering complexity of real-world systems that can be captured as PUSs, we adopt a statistical model checking (SMC) approach for their verification. We develop a new SMC technique based on the direct computation of the significance levels of statistical assertions for HyperPSTL specifications, which requires no a priori knowledge on the indifference margin. Then, we introduce SMC algorithms for HyperPSTL specifications on the joint probabilistic distribution of multiple paths, as well as specifications with nested probabilistic operators quantifying different paths, which cannot be handled by existing SMC algorithms. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our SMC algorithms on CPS benchmarks with varying levels of complexity, including the Toyota Powertrain Control System.},

For one-shot queries, we show that {$\in$}-differential privacy of an n-dimensional input implies a lower bound n - n ln({$\in$}/2) on the entropy of the randomized output, and this lower bound is achieved by adding Laplacian noise. We then consider the {$\in$}-differential privacy of a discrete-time linear feedback system in which noise is added to the system output at each time. The adversary estimates the system states from the output history. We show that, to keep the system {$\in$}-differentially private, the output entropy is bounded below, and this lower bound is achieves by an explicit mechanism.},

To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively attempts to solve a weakened and strengthened versions of the SMT encoding of the reach-avoid problem.

Our model of the adversary abstractly captures typical malicious attacks envisioned on cyber-physical systems such as sensor spoofing, controller corruption, and actuator intrusion. After formulating the problem in a general setting, we present a sound and complete algorithm for the case with linear dynamics and an adversary with a budget on the total L2-norm of its actions. The algorithm relies on a result from linear control theory that enables us to decompose and compute the reachable states of the system in terms of a symbolic simulation of the adversary-free dynamics and the total uncertainty induced by the adversary. With this decomposition, the synthesis problem eliminates the universal quantifier on the adversary's choices and the symbolic controller actions can be effectively solved using an SMT solver. The constraints induced by the adversary are computed by solving second-order cone programmings. The algorithm is later extended to synthesize state-dependent controller and to generate attacks for the adversary. We present preliminary experimental results that show the effectiveness of this approach on several example problems.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of keeping the objective functions of individual agents {$\epsilon$}-differentially private in cloud-based distributed optimization, where agents are subject to global constraints and seek to minimize local objective functions. The communication architecture between agents is cloud-based - instead of communicating directly with each other, they coordinate by sharing states through a trusted cloud computer. In this problem, the difficulty is twofold: the objective functions are used repeatedly in every iteration, and the influence of perturbing them extends to other agents and lasts over time. To solve the problem, we analyze the propagation of perturbations on objective functions over time, and derive an upper bound on them. With the upper bound, we design a noise-adding mechanism that randomizes the cloud-based distributed optimization algorithm to keep the individual objective functions {$\epsilon$}-differentially private. In addition, we study the trade-off between the privacy of objective functions and the performance of the new cloud-based distributed optimization algorithm with noise.

  abstract = {In distributed control systems with shared resources, participating agents can improve the overall performance of the system by sharing data about their personal preferences. In this paper, we formulate and study a natural tradeoff arising in these problems between the privacy of the agent's data and the performance of the control system. We formalize privacy in terms of differential privacy of agents' preference vectors. The overall control system consists of N agents with linear discrete-time coupled dynamics, each controlled to track its preference vector. Performance of the system is measured by the mean squared tracking error. We present a mechanism that achieves differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to the shared information in a way that depends on the sensitivity of the control system to the private data. We show that for stable systems the performance cost of using this type of privacy preserving mechanism grows as O(T3/N{$\epsilon$}2), where T is the time horizon and {$\epsilon$} is the privacy parameter. For unstable systems, the cost grows exponentially with time. From an estimation point of view, we establish a lower-bound for the entropy of any unbiased estimator of the private data from any noise-adding mechanism that gives {$\epsilon$}-differential privacy. We show that the mechanism achieving this lower-bound is a randomized mechanism that also uses Laplace noise.},

Furthermore, a statistical verification algorithm is proposed to verify iLTL formulas on the reduced systems. The correctness of this statistical verification algorithm is checked both by theoretical analysis and the simulation of a fluid problem.

However, since the environmental state depends on the behavior of the agents, sharing it directly among these agents jeopardizes the privacy of the agents' profiles, defined as the combination of the agents' initial states and the sequence of local control inputs over time. A commonly used solution is to randomize the environmental state before sharing - this leads to a natural trade-off between the privacy of the agents' profiles and the variance of estimating the environmental state. By treating the multi-agent system as a probabilistic model of the environmental state parametrized by the agents' profiles, we show that when the agents' profiles is e-differentially private, there is a lower bound on the l1 induced norm of the covariance matrix of the minimum-variance unbiased estimator of the environmental state. This lower bound is achieved by a randomized mechanism that uses Laplace noise.},
